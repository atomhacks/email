Subject: Welcome to Bronx Science Hackers!

Hey {{first}},
Thank you for being a part of Bronx Science Hackers! Whether you signed up at the club fair or you were a member last year, we're glad to have you with us.
We'll send out another email when we know when our first meeting is going to be, but in the meantime I wanted to show you all a cool opportunity:
The U.S. House of Representatives is having its third annual Congressional App Challenge, and in New York City, representatives from districts 6, 8, 9, 10, and 13 are participating. If you live in one of these districts (<a href="https://www.house.gov/representatives/find/">check here</a>), you can participate too! If not, you can join a team with at least two members who live in an eligible district. Sign up for the challenge and learn more <a href="http://www.congressionalappchallenge.us">here</a>.
Also, just to clarify, the "Programming Academy" and Bronx Science Hackers are the same thing.
See you soon!<br>- Jack
